    post:
      summary: Record delivery
      description: When the driver has delivered the container, a request should be
        sent to the server to record (create) the delivery. Note that a delivery is
        associated with a PickupRight, because the driver who gets a PickupRight,
        will automatically get a right to deliver the container. For that reason,
        the PickupRight must be reported.

  /api/v1/users:
    post:
      summary: Register user
      description: |-
        Register information of a user. Note that the "real" (human) user should have
        an account on the blockchain (upfront). This account is represented by an address on the chain, which is based on the public key of the user. Registering therefore means defining user **properties** like a username, which can then be used to refer to users in a more human-friendly way then by using the account addresses. User registration should be done by the user who owns an account on the chain. As a result of registration, a User contract is created on the chain, which contains the user properties, and which is owned by the user account. From then on, one can use the username to refer to a user on the web/mobile app.
