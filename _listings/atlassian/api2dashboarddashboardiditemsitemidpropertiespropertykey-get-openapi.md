  title: Jira Cloud API Get dashboard item property
  description: "Returns the key and value of a dashboard item property.  \n  \nA dashboard
    item enables an app to add user-specific information to a user dashboard. Dashboard
    items are exposed to users as gadgets that users can add to their dashboards.
    For more information on how users do this, see [Adding and customizing gadgets](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/7AeiLQ).
    \ \n  \nWhen an app creates a dashboard item it registers a callback to receive
    the dashboard item ID. The callback fires whenever the item is rendered or, where
    the item is configurable, the user edits the item. The app then uses this resource
    to store the item's content or configuration details. For more information on
    working with dashboard items, see [Building a dashboard item for a JIRA Connect
    add-on](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/guide-building-a-dashboard-item-for-a-jira-connect-add-on-33746254/)
    and the [Dashboard Item](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/dashboard-item/)
    documentation.  \n  \nThere is no resource to set or get dashboard items.  \n
    \ \n**[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ) required:** Permission
    to access Jira. However, to get a dashboard item property the user must be the
    owner of the dashboard or be shared the dashboard. Note, users with the _Administer
    Jira_ [global permission](href=) are considered owners of the System dashboard.
    The System dashboard is considered to be shared with all other users."
