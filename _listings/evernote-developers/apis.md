description: Evernote is a suite of software and services designed for notetaking
  and archiving. A note can be a piece of formatted text, a full webpage or webpage
  excerpt, a photograph, a voice memo, or a handwritten ink note. Notes can also have
  file attachments. Notes can be sorted into folders, then tagged, annotated, edited,
  given comments, searched and exported as part of a notebook. Evernote supports a
  number of operating system platforms (including OS X, iOS, Chrome OS, Android, Microsoft
  Windows, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, and webOS) and also offers online synchronisation
  and backup services.
