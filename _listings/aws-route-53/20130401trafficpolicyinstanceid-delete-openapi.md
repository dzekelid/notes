        Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) loadbalancer, do not create Amazon Route 53 health
        checks for the EC2 instances. When you register anEC2 instance with a load
        balancer, you configure settings for an ELB health check, whichperforms a
        similar function to an Amazon Route 53 health check.You can associate health
        checks with failover resource record sets in a private hostedzone. Note the
        following:Amazon Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the
        health of an endpointwithin a VPC by IP address, you must assign a public
        IP address to the instance in theVPC.You can configure a health checker to
        check the health of an external resource thatthe instance relies on, such
        as a database server.You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm
        with the metric, and then create ahealth check that is based on the state
        of the alarm. For example, you might create a CloudWatchmetric that checks
        the status of the Amazon EC2 StatusCheckFailed metric, add analarm to the
        metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of thealarm.
        For information about creating CloudWatch metrics and alarms by using the

        zones, see Amazon Route 53 Pricing.Note the following:You can't create a hosted
        zone for a top-level domain (TLD).Amazon Route 53 automatically creates a
        default SOA record and four NS records for the zone.For more information about
        SOA and NS records, see NS and SOA Records that Amazon Route 53 Creates for
        a Hosted Zone in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.If your domain is registered
        with a registrar other than Amazon Route 53, you must update thename servers
        with your registrar to make Amazon Route 53 your DNS service. For more information,
        seeConfiguring Amazon Route 53 as your DNSService in the Amazon Route 53 Developer's
        Guide.After creating a zone, its initial status is PENDING. This means that
        itis not yet available on all DNS servers. The status of the zone changes
        to INSYNCwhen the NS and SOA records are available on all Amazon Route 53
        DNS servers. When trying to create a hosted zone using a reusable delegation
        set, specify anoptional DelegationSetId, and Amazon Route 53 would assign
        those 4 NS records for the zone, instead ofallotting a new one.

        with aChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest element. The request body contains a
        list ofchange items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered
        transactional changes.When using the Amazon Route 53 API to change resource
        record sets, Amazon Route 53 either makes all or none of thechanges in a change
        batch request. This ensures that Amazon Route 53 never partially implements
        theintended changes to the resource record sets in a hosted zone. For example,
        a change batch request that deletes the CNAME record forwww.example.com and
        creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com. Amazon Route 53
        deletesthe first resource record set and creates the second resource record
        set in a singleoperation. If either the DELETE or the CREATE action fails,
        thenboth changes (plus any other changes in the batch) fail, and the original
        CNAMErecord continues to exist.ImportantDue to the nature of transactional
        changes, you can''t delete the same resourcerecord set more than once in a
        single change batch. If you attempt to delete the same changebatch more than
        once, Amazon Route 53 returns an InvalidChangeBatch error.NoteTo create resource
        record sets for complex routing configurations, use either thetraffic flow
        visual editor in the Amazon Route 53 console or the API actions for traffic
        policies andtraffic policy instances. Save the configuration as a traffic
        policy, then associate thetraffic policy with one or more domain names (such
        as example.com) or subdomain names (suchas www.example.com), in the same hosted
        zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll backthe updates if the new
        configuration isn''t performing as expected. For more information, seeUsing
        Traffic Flow to Route DNSTraffic in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.Use
        ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest to perform the following actions:                  CREATE:

        If a resource record set does not already exist, AWS createsit. If a resource
        set does exist, Amazon Route 53 updates it with the values in the request.
        The values that you need to include in the request depend on the type of resource

        (for failover, geolocation, latency, and weighted resource record sets)When
        you submit a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, Amazon Route 53 propagates
        your changes to all of the Amazon Route 53 authoritative DNS servers. While
        your changes are propagating, GetChange returns a status of PENDING. When
        propagation is complete, GetChange returns a status of INSYNC. Changes generally
        propagate to all Amazon Route 53 name servers in a few minutes. In rare circumstances,
        propagation can take up to 30 minutes. For more information, see GetChange       For
        information about the limits on a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, see Limits
        in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.'

      summary: List Hosted Zones By Name
      description: 'Retrieves a list of your hosted zones in lexicographic order.
        Send a GETrequest to the /2013-04-01/hostedzonesbyname resource. The response
        includes aHostedZones child element for each hosted zone created by the current
        AWSaccount.             ListHostedZonesByName sorts hosted zones by name with
        the labels reversed.For example:                  com.example.www.               Note
        the trailing dot, which can change the sort order in some circumstances.If
        the domain name includes escape characters or Punycode,ListHostedZonesByName
        alphabetizes the domain name using the escaped orPunycoded value, which is
        the format that Amazon Route 53 saves in its database. For example, to createa
        hosted zone for example.com, specify ex\344mple.com for the domain name.ListHostedZonesByName
        alphabetizes it as:                  com.ex\344mple.               The labels
        are reversed and alphabetized using the escaped value. For more informationabout
        valid domain name formats, including internationalized domain names, see DNS
        Domain Name Format in theAmazon Route 53 Developer Guide.Amazon Route 53 returns
        up to 100 items in each response. If you have a lot of hosted zones, usethe
        MaxItems parameter to list them in groups of up to 100. The response includesvalues
        that help navigate from one group of MaxItems hosted zones to thenext:The
        DNSName and HostedZoneId elements in the responsecontain the values, if any,
        specified for the dnsname andhostedzoneid parameters in the request that produced
        the currentresponse.The MaxItems element in the response contains the value,
        if any, thatyou specified for the maxitems parameter in the request that produced
        thecurrent response.If the value of IsTruncated in the response is true, there
        are morehosted zones associated with the current AWS account. If IsTruncated
        is false, this response includes the last hosted zonethat is associated with
        the current account. The NextDNSName element andNextHostedZoneId elements
        are omitted from the response.The NextDNSName and NextHostedZoneId elements
        in theresponse contain the domain name and the hosted zone ID of the next
        hosted zone that isassociated with the current AWS account. If you want to
        list more hosted zones, makeanother call to ListHostedZonesByName, and specify
        the value ofNextDNSName and NextHostedZoneId in the dnsnameand hostedzoneid
        parameters, respectively.'
